# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System

## Description
Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System is a project that can detect your emotion with few seconds recording. In this project, we choose [EmoDB](http://www.emodb.bilderbar.info/navi.html) and [RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XTBWj-gzZEZ) as my training corpus.

## Environment: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, python 2.7
## Implementation
Use .wav files from EmoDB and RAVDESS as inputs
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Use voice activation detection to get the voiced signal.
  - Pre-emphasis
  - Framing
  - Windowing
  
- **Feature extraction**: Extract acoustic features (e.g. Pitch, Energy, MFCC, etc.) from preprocessed audio signal.

- **Create dataset**: Use the extracted features of audio signals to create a csv format dataset.

- **Train**: Use SVM classification machine learning algorithm to train our model.

- **Features of GUI**:
  - Input: Record or load a .wav file
  - Feature extraction: Use matplotlib to visualize extracted features.
  - Classify: Use pretrained model to get the emotion of input signal.
  - Music recommendation: According to your emotion, we will recommend some music corresponding to your mood.
